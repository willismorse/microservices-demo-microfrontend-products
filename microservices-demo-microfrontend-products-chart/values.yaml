# Default values for chart.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# By default, Helm will auto-generate a single unique name 
# for everything that it creates from your chart. This generated 
# name will be built from your chart name + a random phrase such 
# as "furry-wombat". Helm does this because it assumes that you will 
# want to install multiple copies of your chart, and every instance 
# of your chart will need a name that is unique within the cluster, 
# not just the namespace. This random name generator is just a convenience.
# This is a handy feature, but in our case we will only have one instance
# of the products. So the random naming bit just adds confusion.
# This override value will disable Helm's unique name generation feature.
